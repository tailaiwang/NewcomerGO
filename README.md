NewcomerGO is an RPG-style app that allows new residents of Toronto to explore the city and discover its educational, cultural, and historical landmarks. The app rewards each user's discoveries with points and the chance to win weekly prizes. As a result, newly immigrated youth will feel more welcomed and integrated in Canadian society!
